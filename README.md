# meta_analysis_SPSS_Macros
SPSS Macro versions of MetaES and MetaReg.
This page contains the add-on SPSS versions of the meta analysis macros converted from the sps versions of this website http://mason.gmu.edu/~dwilsonb/ma.html and Robust Meta Regressions converted from RobustMeta.sps of Smith and Tipton (2012).
There are three add-on macros, which can be downloaded below:
a. MeanES.spd 
b. MetaRegression.spd 
c. RobustMetaRegression.spd
After the macros are installed, they can be found under "Analyze" in the SPSS menu.
Click the blue arrow on the lower right of the page to download it and double click the file to install. 
Alternatively, the macro can be installed using custom dialog under Utilities menu in SPSS 
(need to launch SPSS as administrator in order to do so: select SPSS icon in your PC, right click and select Run as administrator}.
Thanks for Prof. Wilson who gives me permissions to convert his sps versions into the add-on versions.
